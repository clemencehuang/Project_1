# Griefwell London
## Website Overview
Welcome to Griefwell - Griefwell was founded by Felicia McDonald, who suffered the sudden loss of her beloved mother in 2020, two weeks before the UK went into lockdown. Subsequently she also lost her health and her sense of identity and gradually had to find a way to rebuild her life and herself. Realising how ill-equipped she was in handling her loss and grief, she went on a journey to discover ways to overcome them. Now, as a certified Grief Recovery Specialist and Coach, Decluttering Coach, and Reiki Practitioner, she helps women create the ​emotional and physical space to help them process a loss, and to empower them to be an active participant in their grief ​journey.

## Content and Structure

### Header
The same header is used across the site to hold the navigation bar and the site title.

### Logos
The logo is set in an elegant, gentle font with serif detailing to reference the bespoke service Griefwell offers. A special font was used on the hero landing page image to set the scene; a neon yellow was used in deliberate contrast to the otherwise earthy colours of the site, to give a modern twist and add an uplifting element to it.

### Color Scheme
A subdued colour palette in pastel tones has been chosen to create a gentle website environment that feels inviting and open to a potential female client base. 

### Navigation Bar
* The navigation bar appears on all four pages. 
* It contains links to Home, About, Services and Contacts pages.
* The menu sits in a horizontal flow for larger screen sizes and turns into a burger menu for mobile and tablet.

### Footer
* The footer is replicated across all pages, deliberately sticking to the the bottom of each page, acting as a re-enforcement of the Griefwell brand and name.

## Future-Enhancements

* Create more varied layouts across each page in order to feel less repetitive and more engaging for the user.
* Add two more photos to the About page: one of Felicia McDonald and one black and white childhood photo of her with her mother.
* Add a form to the Contacts page so that users can send messages to Felicia McDonald.
* Evolve the website into a full services platform where users can book services and exhange messages on a community forum.
* Add a live calendar of events.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS Validation Service were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) 
    
    **HOME** page:

    Initial tests show four warnings and two errors to be corrected.
    ![Initial test results](assets/validation/w3_validator/errors/project_1_index.png)
    After fixing the errors, the final test results confirm no errors. I've left the warnings untouched for now as my mark-up was previously too complex, resulting in display errors linked to the css. I had deliberately made the mark-up simpler so felt it was best to leave it untouched at this stage.

    **SERVICES** page:

    Initial tests show various errors to be corrected.

    After fixing the errors, the final test results confirm no errors or warnings.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, using DevTools across various breakpoints for mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop.
-   All links were tested across all pages and device breakpoints.

### Accessibility
Making the website accessible was paramount in order to adhere to web standards but most importantly, to be able to reach as wide an audience as possible and to make the user experience across various devices as user friendly and legible as possible.

* Semantic elements are used throughout the website
* All images were converted into WEBP, a reduced file size to support the load time of images (https://image.online-convert.com/).
* All images contained an alt tag whenever possible.
* The site is responsive to different screen sizes.

### Known Bugs

* About Page: The hero image on the About page disappears in mobile view. 
    - Solution:  xxxxx.

### General References
* I used online course material from the Code Institute to learn HTML and CSS alongside W3Schools, Stack Overflow, CodePen and YouTube for general "How To's". I used the Mimo app as an additional learning path which helped with step-by-step practice and also offered snippets of new code that I hadn't picked up through the Code Institute modules.
