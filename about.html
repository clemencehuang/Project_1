                    A significant loss can completely destabilise us, but we do have ​the power to better manage that process and 
                    our journey. We ​often don’t realise how much our environment and actions ​impact our recovery. <strong>Griefwell</strong> was 
                    born in London out of my ​own experience with loss and trauma, and a desire to support ​and guide women to become 
                    the leaders of their own grief ​journey. With proper tools and spaces we can better shift our ​grief and embrace 
                    its transformative power. <br>
                    <br>
                    As a certified Grief Recovery Specialist and Coach, Decluttering Coach, and Reiki Practitioner, I help women 
                    create the ​emotional and physical space to help them process a loss, and to empower them to be an active 
                    participant in their grief ​journey. <br>           
                </p>
                <p>
                    After more than 15+ years living in London and working in the fashion industry, I suddenly suffered a loss 
                    that forever ​changed me. Not only had I lost one of the most important people in my life, my beloved mother 
                    and best friend, I also lost ​my health and my sense of identity - I developed PPPD, lived far from home, had 
                    no siblings, and no parents now - it was life-​changing. <br>
                    <br>
                    Step by step I had to rebuild my life and myself, and it was only through my own trauma and challenges did I realise ​how debilitating a significant loss could 
                    be, how ill-equipped many of us are to handle loss and grief, and how little space many ​of us have to grieve 
                    healthily. Only by trying different things did I come to acknowledge the importance of creating and ​holding 
                    space, as well as having a toolkit to process loss. <br>
                    <br>
                    I trained as a Grief Recovery Method Specialist and Reiki (I &II) ​practitioner, and started to coach others in learning to clear clutter and let go. Embracing a different 
                    version of myself by taking ​small but significant actions was key to my recovery. Recovery does not mean returning 
                    to the same person you were, but ​learning to find happiness and lightness in the every day again.<br>
                    <br>
                    Grief is not about stages or waiting for time to heal you, it isn’t linear. It curves, zigzags, and is completely 
                    unpredictable, but ​one can learn to be an active participant of that journey and embrace its presence. The more 
                    we can embrace the ebb and ​flow of grief, the easier it is to manage it. Learning to accept grief and loss is a 
                    life-long skill that we all need to put into action, as ​no one is immune to loss. I hope to help others do this.
