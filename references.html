    --- HELPING YOU SHIFT YOUR GRIEF
    Each grief journey is unique, but creating the emotional, mental, and physical space is ​essential to helping 
    you process complicated emotions.

    We are socialised to hide and hold on to pain and suffering, and this can be ​exhausting, isolating, and 
    counter-productive to healing. Griefwell is about ​helping you build the tools and environment to better process 
    loss and grief, ​and empower you to be the leader of your own grief journey.

    Time doesn’t heal a broken heart, but small actions and clear spaces can help ​you move forward.

    --- WHAT IS LOSS?
    Many of us associate grief with a bereavement, and losing someone is one of the most ​significant losses one can 
    ever experience. However, many other losses can also lead to a ​profound sense of grief; loss of health or career, 
    divorce, infertility, etc...

    Early mid-life is when many women start to identify more losses and those losses start ​to impact our wellbeing. 
    We may start to experience the death of a parent or ageing ​parents, poor health, infertility, divorce, change or 
    loss of career, and many other losses. ​And we sometimes view these losses as a failure, suffer alone, and feel 
    overwhelmed.

    Some losses impact us forever and it is important we have a toolkit and clear and safe ​spaces to explore our 
    relationship with grief so we can grow and heal alongside it.

    --- SECTION 5 
    --- WHERE DO I START?
    When we are suffering from a significant loss, we feel uncomfortable, vulnerable, and ​unable to take action. 
    Everything feels overwhelming. My role is to assess what would ​serve you best at that moment.

    For some, they are not ready to talk and work through their grief, and so removing ​some physical clutter in 
    their life might offer them the space and breathing room to ​‘feel’ and consider their next steps. For some, 
    they are so exhausted emotionally that ​Reiki energy healing might help them restore some calm and replenish 
    their energy ​before they are ready to confront their grief. And for others, taking action toward their ​grief 
    right away might be their focus, and they want to start mapping out those ​undelivered communications.

    Grief is unique, and so is the way we process and embrace it. My goal is not to ​overwhelm you, but to support 
    you in heart, mind, body, and spirit. Book a free ​discovery call to work through what would work best for YOU.

    --- SECTION 1 
    --- ABOUT
    A significant loss can completely destabilise us, but we do have ​the power to better manage that process and 
    our journey. We ​often don’t realise how much our environment and actions ​impact our recovery. Griefwell was 
    born in London out of my ​own experience with loss and trauma, and a desire to support ​and guide women to become 
    the leaders of their own grief ​journey. With proper tools and spaces we can better shift our ​grief and embrace 
    its transformative power.

    As a certified Grief Recovery Specialist and Coach, Decluttering Coach, and Reiki Practitioner, I help women 
    create the ​emotional and physical space to help them process a loss, and to empower them to be an active 
    participant in their grief ​journey.

    After more than 15+ years living in London and working in the fashion industry, I suddenly suffered a loss 
    that forever ​changed me. Not only had I lost one of the most important people in my life, my beloved mother 
    and best friend, I also lost ​my health and my sense of identity - I developed PPPD, lived far from home, had 
    no siblings, and no parents now - it was life-​changing. Step by step I had to rebuild my life and myself, 
    and it was only through my own trauma and challenges did I realise ​how debilitating a significant loss could 
    be, how ill-equipped many of us are to handle loss and grief, and how little space many ​of us have to grieve 
    healthily. Only by trying different things did I come to acknowledge the importance of creating and ​holding 
    space, as well as having a toolkit to process loss. I trained as a Grief Recovery Method Specialist and Reiki 
    (I &II) ​practitioner, and started to coach others in learning to clear clutter and let go. Embracing a different 
    version of myself by taking ​small but significant actions was key to my recovery. Recovery does not mean returning 
    to the same person you were, but ​learning to find happiness and lightness in the every day again.

    Grief is not about stages or waiting for time to heal you, it isn’t linear. It curves, zigzags, and is completely 
    unpredictable, but ​one can learn to be an active participant of that journey and embrace its presence. The more 
    we can embrace the ebb and ​flow of grief, the easier it is to manage it. Learning to accept grief and loss is a 
    life-long skill that we all need to put into action, as ​no one is immune to loss. I hope to help others do this.

    ​supporter and cheerleader!

    TITLE over hero image:
    GRIEF WELLNESS IS ABOUT ​EMPOWERING OURSELVES SO THAT ​WE ARE BETTER ABLE TO PROCESS ​LOSS.

    --- Heading 1 
    --- GRIEF RECOVERY WORK

    Grief work is about holding space for ​your loss and grief. It is also about ​debunking any myths around grief 
    ​and taking action toward processing ​any unresolved emotions.

    A 7-week action and evidence-based programme to help you process any unresolved grief. ​Grief is a natural and 
    normal reaction to a significant loss, and yet many of us are not ​properly equipped to handle grief when faced 
    with it. We keep thinking time will heal, but ​that is often a misconception and we keep waiting for the weight 
    to be lifted.

    Any undelivered communications will remain with us, as will all of those unmet hopes, ​dreams, and expectations. 
    In order for us to grow positively with our grief, we need to deliver ​and complete those relationships that 
    leave us unsettled and unhappy. This programme is ​about giving space, voice, and acknowledgment to all your 
    emotions around a loss, and for ​you to learn tools to help you to manage grief moving forward.

    Loss includes but is not limited to bereavement, divorce, loss of health, loss of career, ​infertility, 
    loss of trust, etc... A loss is a change in a relationship with someone, something or a ​pattern of behaviour, 
    and some losses can create feelings of grief.

    I will guide and coach you through the programme, and together we will map out your losses ​and relationships 
    and those undelivered communications that may be keeping you stuck. ​You will learn to be an active participant 
    in your grief journey, and feel more empowered.

    --- REIKI ENERGY HEALING 

    Loss can be emotionally depleting and it’s ​important to carve out space for self-care ​and to restore your energy. 
    Through the ​soft practice of reiki you experience a sense ​of calm and relaxation.

    Reiki is an energy healing practice from Japan. This technique focuses on energy and life force as a way to 
    promote healing and reduce stress. Through intention and gentle hand movements energy is encouraged to flow 
    and move throughout the body. It’s a very calming experience which can be very beneficial when grieving.

    It opens up space within the body and mind to better manage emotions.

    --- DECLUTTERING

    The simple yet impactful act of ​decluttering and organising your home ​and environment can help you create the ​
    necessary space to process grief and heal. It ​allows you to regain a sense of control ​when feeling overwhelmed.

    Decluttering is a powerful action that allows one to carve out the physical space needed for ​emotional healing. 
    Our physical environments have an impact on how we process feelings. If ​our spaces and minds are cluttered, 
    it is more often difficult to process emotions. By ​decluttering and organising your spaces you give yourself the 
    breathing room needed to ​heal, and it enhances the grief journey experience by allowing you to focus on what is 
    truly ​important and the steps needed for recovery.
