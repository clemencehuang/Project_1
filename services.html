                <p>
                    GRIEF WELLNESS IS ABOUT ​EMPOWERING OURSELVES SO THAT ​WE ARE BETTER ABLE TO PROCESS ​LOSS.<br>
                    <br>
                    Grief work is about holding space for ​your loss and grief. It is also about ​debunking any myths around grief 
                    ​and taking action toward processing ​any unresolved emotions.<br>
<br>
                    A 7-week action and evidence-based programme to help you process any unresolved grief. ​Grief is a natural and 
                    normal reaction to a significant loss, and yet many of us are not ​properly equipped to handle grief when faced 
                    with it. We keep thinking time will heal, but ​that is often a misconception and we keep waiting for the weight 
                    to be lifted.<br>
<br>
                    Any undelivered communications will remain with us, as will all of those unmet hopes, ​dreams, and expectations. 
                    In order for us to grow positively with our grief, we need to deliver ​and complete those relationships that 
                    leave us unsettled and unhappy. This programme is ​about giving space, voice, and acknowledgment to all your 
                    emotions around a loss, and for ​you to learn tools to help you to manage grief moving forward.<br>
<br>
                    Loss includes but is not limited to bereavement, divorce, loss of health, loss of career, ​infertility, 
                    loss of trust, etc... A loss is a change in a relationship with someone, something or a ​pattern of behaviour, 
                    and some losses can create feelings of grief.<br>
<br>
                    I will guide and coach you through the programme, and together we will map out your losses ​and relationships 
                    and those undelivered communications that may be keeping you stuck. ​You will learn to be an active participant 
                    in your grief journey, and feel more empowered.<br>

                <p>Loss can be emotionally depleting and it’s ​important to carve out space for self-care ​and to restore your energy. 
                    Through the ​soft practice of reiki you experience a sense ​of calm and relaxation.<br>
                    <br>
                    Reiki is an energy healing practice from Japan. This technique focuses on energy and life force as a way to 
                    promote healing and reduce stress. Through intention and gentle hand movements energy is encouraged to flow 
                    and move throughout the body. It’s a very calming experience which can be very beneficial when grieving.<br>
                    <br>
                    It opens up space within the body and mind to better manage emotions.<br>

                <h3 id="services-h3-3">Decluttering</h3>     
                <p>    The simple yet impactful act of ​decluttering and organising your home ​and environment can help you create the ​
                        necessary space to process grief and heal. It ​allows you to regain a sense of control ​when feeling overwhelmed.<br>
                        <br>
                        Decluttering is a powerful action that allows one to carve out the physical space needed for ​emotional healing. 
                        Our physical environments have an impact on how we process feelings. If ​our spaces and minds are cluttered, 
                        it is more often difficult to process emotions. By ​decluttering and organising your spaces you give yourself the 
                        breathing room needed to ​heal, and it enhances the grief journey experience by allowing you to focus on what is 
                        truly ​important and the steps needed for recovery.<br>
